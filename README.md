# Minimalisp

A minimal LISP/Scheme for pedagogical purposes.

## Rationale

[XKCD: LISP cycles](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/297:_Lisp_Cycles)

I once read someone opine that writing a LISP interpreter was like a Jedi apprentice building their own lightsabre - the last part of your apprenticeship before you graduated to become a Jedi Knight.

Unfortunately a brief Internet search turns up nothing canonical, so I'll have to leave the XKCD as my only reference.

Nevertheless, LISP can be a suitably simple and manageable target language for an interpreter project. Why not a compiler, you ask? Because macros require an interpreter, so even a compiler will have to interpret.

Implementations are in language-focussed folders:
